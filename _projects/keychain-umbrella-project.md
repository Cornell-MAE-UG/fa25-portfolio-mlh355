In spring of 2025, with a group of other undergraduate engineers I was asked to complete a semester-long project following the engineering design process. We began by brainstorming problems that people we knew had. After this, we chose an issue we wanted to address, for us this was being caught in rainy Ithaca weather. We devised solutions to this problem and conducted interviews before ultimately landing on an umbrella you could attach to a keychain. This would allow the user to always have the umbrella and never be caught without it. 
We used CAD to design our product, before sending parts to be 3D printed, laser-cut, and ordered. We were given a budget so in addition to choosing the best materials for the design, we had to be conscious of the decisions we were making. Once the parts were delivered we could assemble our product. This became our first iteration. After this we evaluated the validity of our product, made changes, designed and ordered new parts, and finally created our final product. 
This project allowed me to fully experience the engineering process, from designing, to troubleshooting, to assembling.
