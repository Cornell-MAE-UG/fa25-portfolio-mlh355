VRow is an applied sports research project team with the goal of creating a virtual reality platform that offers year-round access to realistic rowing training. Specifically, I have been working on developing the user interface to allow the athlete to control the simulation via subtle body movements. In addition to creating an interface to allow Python code to be modified by what the user is choosing. Overall, allowing the user to be in control of what they are experiencing.
